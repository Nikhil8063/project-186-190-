               <p>In biomedical image registration, the most frequently used interpolation methods include
nearest neighbor, linear, bilinear, trilinear, cubic, bicubic, tricubic, quadrilinear, and cubic
convolution interpolation. The more complex the interpolation methods, the more
surrounding points concerned, and the slower the registration speed. In order to speed
up the registration procedure, low cost interpolation techniques are often preferred.
Because of its good trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity, the
bilinear interpolation is the most commonly used method (Zitová and Flusser, 2003).
According to the research of Thévenaz, Blu, and Unser (2000), in cardiac and thorax image
registration, trilinear interpolation can help to achieve good registration performance.<br><br>

The optimization algorithm is required by almost every registration procedure, which
serves as a searching strategy. There are several optimization algorithms often used in
the biomedical image registration. The exhaustive searching method has been selected
as optimization strategy by researchers. However, because of its high computational
complexity, the exhaustive method for searching for the global optimization is not an
efficient choice. The Powell algorithm by Powell (1964) and Simplex method by Nelder and
Mead (1965) are more efficient than the exhaustive searching strategy in finding an
optimum solution.<br><br>
                   
The Powell algorithm has been used frequently as an optimization strategy for biomedical
image registration, for example, Collignon et al. (1995), Maes, Collignon, Vandermeulen,
Marchal, and Suetens (1997), Wang and Feng (2005). The Powell algorithm performs a
succession of one-dimensional optimizations, finding in turn the best solution along
each freedom degree, and then returning to the first degree of freedom. The algorithm
stops when it is unable to find a new solution with a significant improvement to the
current solution.<br><br>
                   
The Downhill-Simplex algorithm has been used by, for example, Hill et al. (1993) and van
Herk and Kooy (1994). Rohlfing and Maurer (2003) adopted a variant of the Downhill-Simplex algorithm restricted to the direction of the steepest ascent.<br><br>
                   
In order to search a vast number of parameters, which represent the complex deformation
fields, multi-resolution optimization algorithms have been adopted by researchers in the
biomedical image registration community, for example, Penny (1998). Initially, the
registration is performed at coarse spatial scales, then to the finer ones. These multiresolution or coarse-to-fine optimization algorithms can accelerate computation and help
to escape from the local minima.<br><br>
                   

<h3>Performance Validation of Biomedical Image Registration</h3>
<hr>


<p> For all types of registration, assessment of the registration accuracy is very important.
A medical image registration method cannot be accepted as a clinical tool to make
decisions about patient management until it has been proved to be accurate enough.
Important criteria for assessing the performance of registration schemes are accuracy,
robustness, usability, and computational complexity. The often used validation methods
include Fiducial landmarks, Phantom studies, and Visual inspection.
</p>
      

        
   <p>Fiducial landmarks, which can predict the expected error distribution, have been devised
to assess the registration accuracy. To a certain extent, assessment using fiducial
landmarks provides a “gold standard” for medical image registration. However, the
fiducial landmarks can either suffer from the movement of skin mobility or are highly
invasive. Also, these validation measures cannot be applied retrospectively.<br><br>
       
    Phantom studies are important for the estimation of the registration accuracy because
the data and displacement information is fully known beforehand. Phantom-based
validations provide measures for mean transformation errors and computational complexity for different methods, and they are especially useful for estimating the accuracy
of intra-modality registration methods.<br><br>
Visual inspection, which provides a qualitative assessment, is the most intuitive method
for evaluation of the registration accuracy. This assessment method may involve the
inspection of subtraction images, contour overlays, or viewing anatomical landmarks. It
has been used widely in both rigid and non-rigid registration assessment, but it may be
considered as an informal and insufficient approach.<br><br>
Researchers have been developing novel and practical validation techniques, for
example, Hellier, Barillot, Memin and Perez (2001) proposed a hierarchical estimation
method for 3-D registration. The measurement of the consistency of transformations has
been proposed to serve as accuracy qualification method by, for example, Holden et al.
(2000). Wang, Feng, Yeh, and Huang (2001) proposed a novel automatic method to
estimate confidence intervals of the resulting registration parameters and allow the
precision of registration results to be objectively assessed for 2-D and 3-D medical
images. Fitzpatrick, Hill, and Maurer (2000); Mäkelä, Clarysse, Sipilä, Pauna, Pham, Katila,
and Magnin (2002), and Zitová and Flusser (2003) presented good discussions and
summaries about performance validation methods for medical image registration.<br><br>
However, validation of registration accuracy is a difficult task because of the lack of the
ground truth. Objective performance validation still remains a challenge in the field of
biomedical image registration.<br><br><br>
       
       <h1>Major Biomedical Image Registration Methodologies</h1>
        <hr>
        
        As described previously, the biomedical image registration methods can be divided into
intensity-based category and feature-based category.
        <h3>Intensity-Based Medical Image Registration</h3>
        <hr>
        
        Intensity-based medical image registration fully and directly exploits the image raw
intensities, and an explicit segmentation of the images is not required. Therefore, this
category of registration provides high registration accuracy. Because of little or no user
<br><br>
        
interaction involved in this kind of registration, fully automated registration and
quantitative assessment become possible. However, this category of schemes does not
make use of knowledge of the organ structure and also the registration computation is
not very efficient. The well-established intensity-based similarity measures used in the
biomedical image registration area include minimizing the intensity differences, correla-tion-based techniques, and entropy-based techniques.<br><br>
Similarity measures by minimizing the intensity differences include the Sum of Squared
Differences (SSD) and the Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD), which exhibit a minimum
in the case of perfect matching. Although they are efficient to calculate, these methods
are sensitive to intensity changes.<br><br>
<center><img src="Screenshot%20(52).png     "></center><br><br><br>
        Where <i>R(i)</i> is the intensity value at position <i> i</i> of reference image <i> R</i> and <i> S(i)</i> is the
corresponding intensity value in study image <i> S; T</i> is geometric transformation.<br><br>
Correlation techniques were proposed to aim at multimodal biomedical image registra-tion, for example, Maintz, van den Elsen, and Viergeve (1996). The cross-correlation
technique has also been used for rigid motion correction of SPECT cardiac images, for
example, Mäkelä et al. (2002). However, because usually the geometric deformations of
the image modalities are not likely to be linear, these correlation methods, which require
a linear dependence between the intensity of the images, cannot always achieve reliable
registration results. The normalized cross correlation is defined as:<br><br>
<center><img src="Screenshot%20(55).png     "></center><br><br><br>
        Where<i>I</i><sub>R</sub>(i) is the intensity value at position<i> i</i> of reference image<i> R</i> and<i>I<sub>S</sub>
(i)</i> is the
corresponding intensity value in study image <i>S; I<sub>R</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>S</sub></i> 
are the mean intensity value
of reference and study image respectively.<br><br>
Information theoretic techniques play an essential role in multimodality medical image
registration.<br><br>
The Shannon entropy is widely used as a measure of information in many branches of
engineering. It was originally developed as a part of information theory in the 1940s and
describes the average information supplied by a set of symbols {x} whose probabilities
are given by {<i>p(x)</i>}.<br><br><br>
        
        
       <center> <img src="Screenshot%20(56).png"></center><br><br><br>
        In image registration area, when the images are correctly aligned, the joint histograms
have tight clusters and the joint entropy is minimized. These clusters disperse as the
images become less well registered, and correspondingly, the joint entropy is increased.
Because minimizing the entropy does not require that the histograms are unimodal, the
joint entropy is generally applicable to multimodality registration and obviates the need
of segmentation of images.<br><br>
Mutual information (MI) was first proposed by Collignon et al. (1995) and Viola et al.
(1995), and it is a promising and powerful criterion for multimodality medical image
registration, for example, Maes, et al. (1997); Roche, Malandain, and Ayache (2000);
Thevenaz and Unser (2000); and Likar and Pernus (2001).<br><br>
Let<i> R</i> be the reference data presented by<i> m</i> samples {r<sub>0</sub>, r<sub>1</sub>, ..., r<sub>m–1</sub>} with a marginal
probability distribution <i>P<sub>R</sub>(r).</i> Analogously, the study data<i> S</i> consists of<i> n</i> samples <i>{s<sub>0</sub>,s<sub>1</sub>, ..., s<sub>n–1</sub>}</i> with a marginal probability distribution<i> P<sub>S</sub>
(s).</i> The mutual information <i>I</i> of the
reference image<i> R</i> and study image <i>S</i> measures the degree of dependence of R and S by
measuring distance between the joint distribution<i> P<sub>RS</sub>(r,s)</i> and the distribution associated
to<i> P<sub>R</sub>(r)</i> and<i>P</i><sub>S</sub>(s). MI can be defined as:<br><br>
        
       <center> <img src="Screenshot%20(58).png"></center><br><br>
        
        With<i> H(R)</i> and <i>H(s)</i> being the entropy of R and S, respectively,<i> H(R,S)</i> is their joint
entropy.<br><br>
        
         <center><img src="Screenshot%20(59).png"></center><br>
        
        
       MI is related to entropy by the equation:<br><br>
        
         <center><img src="Screenshot%20(53).png"></center><br><br>
        
        Under the assumption that the mutual information of the two images is maximum when
the images are in registration, registration can be performed by maximizing the mutual
information as a function of a geometric transformation T of the study image S:<br><br><br>
        
         <center><img src="Screenshot%20(54).png"></center><br><br>
        
        <i>T</i><sub>reg</sub> is the transformation that will bring the images into registration.
Mutual information registration does not assume a linear relationship among intensity
values of the images to be registered and is one of the few intensity-based measures that
are well suited to the multimodality image registration.<br><br><br>
        
        <h3>Feature-Based Medical Image Registration</h3>
        <hr>
        In feature-based registration approaches, transformations often can be stated in analytic
form, hence efficient computational schemes can be achieved. However, in most of these
methods, the preprocess step is needed and the registration results are highly dependent
on the result of this preprocess. Because registration algorithms using landmarks often
require users to specify corresponding landmarks from the two images manually or semiautomatically, such methods cannot always provide very accurate registration.<br><br>
The feature-based medical image registration methods can be classified into point-based
approaches, for example, Fitzpatrick, West, and Maurer (1998), curve-based algorithms,
for example, Maintz et al. (1996), and Subsol (1999), and surface-based methods, for
example, Chen, Pellizari, Chen, Cooper, and Levin (1987); Borgefors (1988), and Pellizari,
Chen, Spelbring, Weichselbaum, and Chen (1989). Figure 4 illustrates the feature-based
registration procedure. Point-based registration involves identifying the corresponding
points, matching the points, and inferring the image transformation.<br><br>
The corresponding points are also called homologous landmarks to emphasize that they
should present the same feature in the different images. These points can either be
anatomical features or markers attached to the patient, which can be identified in both
images modalities. Anatomical landmark based registration methods have the drawback
of user interaction being required. Registration algorithms based on extrinsic landmarks
which maybe invasive or non-invasive, are comparatively easy to implement, fast, and
can be automated, but they may have drawbacks of invasiveness and less accurate
results. As a successful example, iterative closest points (ICP) method proposed by Besl
and McKay (1992), maybe the most widely used medical image registration approach in
medical imaging applications, for example, Fitzpatrick, West, and Maurer (1998).<br><br>
When points are available, Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) which produce a smoothly interpo-lated spatial mapping, are often used to determine the transformation for 2-D medical
image registration, for example, Bookstein (1989).<br><br>
Boundaries or surfaces are distinct features in medical image registration due to various
segmentation algorithms which can successfully locate such features. Surface-based
registration methods can be rigid or deformable.
